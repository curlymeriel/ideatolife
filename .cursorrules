# AI Operational Principles for Project "IdeaToLife"

## 1. Environment & Shell (Windows PowerShell)
- **Identify Environment**: This is a Windows system using PowerShell.
- **Strict Command Usage**: 
    - NEVER use `grep`, `find`, or `rm -rf` directly in `run_command`. 
    - Use `grep_search` and `find_by_name` tools for all searching operations.
    - Use built-in PowerShell equivalents only if tools are insufficient (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`, `Remove-Item`).
- **Path Handling**: Always use absolute paths. Avoid using relative paths like `./` or `../` in tool calls unless specified otherwise.

## 2. Tool-First Policy
- **Prefer Specialized Tools**: 
    - Use `grep_search` for text content searching.
    - Use `find_by_name` for file/directory discovery.
    - Use `list_dir` for exploring folder structures.
- **Fail-Safe Mode**: If a command fails due to "Invalid Directory" or "Command Not Found", DO NOT retry the same command. Switch to specialized tools immediately.

## 3. Web Development & Aesthetics
- **Core Stack**: HTML, Javascript, Vanilla CSS (unless Tailwind is already in use).
- **Design Excellence**: Prioritize premium aesthetics, smooth animations, and curated color palettes.
- **No Placeholders**: Use `generate_image` for missing assets.

## 4. Stability Logic
- **Prevention of "Death"**: If execution terminates unexpectedly (e.g., terminal error), analyze the command environment mismatch first before proceeding.
- **Task Verification**: Always verify terminal command results via `command_status` and wait for completion.
